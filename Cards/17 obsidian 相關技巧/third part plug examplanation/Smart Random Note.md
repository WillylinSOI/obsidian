# Smart Random Note Obsidian Plugin

This plugin enhances opening random notes.

Three commands are available:

-   Open Random Note from Search: opens a random note from the list of search results.
-   Insert Link at Cursor to Random Note from Search: inserts a link where the cursor is positioned to a raondom note from the list of search results.
-   Open Tagged Random Note: opens a random note that has a selected tag.
-   Open Random Note: behaves similarly to the core random note plugin.

## Future Plans

-   Originally I had plans to implement spaced repetition capabilities, but other plugins have been developed that handle that domain well. They are:
    -   [Flashcards](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian)
    -   [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition)
    -   [Recall](https://github.com/martin-jw/obsidian-recall)
-   I'd like to stay as close as possible to the Unix adage "do one thing, and do it well" with this plugin. Therefore any features and improvements must stay close to its core function: opening random notes with greater control.

## Installation

### From within Obsidian

From Obsidian 0.9.8, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

-   Open Settings > Third-party plugin

## Compatibility

Custom plugins are officially supported in Obsidian version 0.9.7. This plugin currently targets API version 0.9.15 but should be compatible with version 0.9.7 or higher.
